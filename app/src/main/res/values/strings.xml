    <string name="description">"This app here is trying to give a sigh of relief to all board examination\'s students by providing some previous year's question papers with their solutions to help them provide a quick revision of their entire syllabus. \n \n CBSE repeats the same type of questions in the exams over the years.\n \nIt's a small effort by
        the developer to ease the board examination's pressure for students like you. \n \n BEST OF LUCK FOR YOUR BOARD EXAMS!\n \n \nAnd lastly I'd like to sincerely thanks \nMr. Anurag Bishwas\nMr. Nitin Agrawal\nMr. Praveen Bansal\n for guiding and helping me throughout this project.   \n \n \n-Aman Tyagi\nanuntah"</string>
